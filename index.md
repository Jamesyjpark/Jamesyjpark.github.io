### Data Scientist @ ReviveMed

[Network Analysis](https://www.revivemed.io/)
<img src="images/nash2.jpg?raw=true"/>

From a graph database composed of millions of known molecular interactions, I create species, disease, and tissue specific molecular graphs that are subgraphs of the entire network. I then apply graph algorithms like deep-walk and artificial intelligence to identify potential therapeutic targets.

[Feature Engine](https://www.revivemed.io/)

Quality control for raw omics data is performed that involves various steps such as normalizing data and removing outliers. After quality control, different simple and multivariate statistical tests such as partial least square regression are used to prioritize important biological features. These features are filtered and used to create a disease module using ReviveMed mathematical algorithms.

### Graduate Thesis @ Harvard University

[Associations Between Volitional Physical Activity and Mortality Index](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/5kpW21dsRLKtEo)

<img src="images/simulations.jpg?raw=true"/>

People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) are living longer but with increased risk for functional decline compared to HIV negative adults of the same age. Literature suggests that slower walking speed is associated with adverse health outcomes, and faster decrease in walking speed is correlated with worse health outcomes. My thesis explored the role of Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) indices as the predictors of accelerometry-based physical activity in two HIV cohorts. 

I explored different models such as linear mixed model and generalized estimating equations. Additionally, I performed power and bias simulations to see how the results change by adding different noise to the data.

### Data Fellow @ CDC

The Chronic Viral Diseases Branch (CVDB) has tested for HPV genotypes in over 80,000
specimens to measure the impact of vaccination in US surveillance studies. For reliable monitoring of
trends, quality assurance of the assays is vital. CVDB uses multiple processes and controls to assure the
performance of qualitative assays for detection of over 30 HPV genotypes. 

Assay results are reviewed quarterly in summary reports before data is submitted to partners. The quality assurance
process has led to valuable insights and interventions.

[Data Management and Policy Implementation](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/ozCQtel50xfXnC)

As a data fellow, I contributed to consolidatiing assay results of different studies from multiple Microsoft Access databases into one centralized SQL database.

[R Package Development to Automate HPV Assay Result Summary](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/oTZDKt4KIkiE1a)

I developed an R-package that automates the quarterly report generation process that was previously done using excel sheets. The R pacakge generates a quarterly report more reliably and about 818 times faster.
